\subsection{Builtin functions}

Tasks:

Create a spreadsheet for calculating grades for students in a math course.


Create subtotals for homework, quizzes and exams, also a grand total with homework weighted $20\%$, quizzes weighted
$30\%$ and exams weighted $50\%$.

Use the MIN function to "drop the lowest quiz."

Use functions to assign letter grades with $+$ and $-$ modifiers.

\subsection{Absolute and relative cell references}

Tasks:

Create a table of the binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

Revisit the grade spreadsheet from the previous section and insert a new row at the top.  Put the "weights" for homework, 
quizzes and exams into cells in this row.  (As the teacher you might want to experiment with different 
weighting schemes.) Are the final grades changes by much if we change the weights to 10, 
20 and 70 percent respectively?


Use a spreadsheet to do a finite differences analysis. 

Find the "back diagonals" for the sequences of squares, cubes, 4th powers etc.

Given that the back diagonal for $x^n$ contains $s(n,k)*k!$ in the $k$th row, and the recursion for
the Stirling numbers.  Use a spreadsheet to create a table of the Stirling numbers.

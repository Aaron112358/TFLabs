Computer Algebra is an important and growing area that is of fundamental use to mathematicians and scientists.  
Roughly speaking, a Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) is intended to automate routine calculations -- the interface is usually designed so that it matches better with human understanding of a mathematical situation (at least better then traditional programming languages!)  

So, for example we've all learned how to factor polynomials in order to find their zeros.  If I asked you to solve

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

\noindent you'd probably be able to quickly factor the polynomial on the left-hand-side like so:

\[ (x-2)(x-3) = 0 \]

\noindent and conclude that $x=2$ and $x=3$ are solutions.

Now, imagine you were asked to find the solutions o

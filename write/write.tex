\section{LaTeX}
\label{sec:latex}

Donald Knuth is an amazing Zen master of Computer Science and Mathematics.  He created a program called \TeX (pronounced like ``tech'') for typesetting -- especially typesetting with mathematical content.  Knuth wrote \TeX mainly as an example of a style of coding that he called ``literate programming.''  Essentially this means that the programmer creates the documentation for their work at the same time they write the actual code.  Whether it's because of it being written in the ``literate programming'' style or simply because of Knuth's amazingness, \TeX is renowned as one of the most bug-free systems in existance. 

\TeX, and a follow-on program known as \LaTeX which builds on \TeX and extends it, have become the standard(s) for communicating mathematics.
